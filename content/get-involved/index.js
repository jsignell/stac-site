### Community calls and working sessions

We also do video calls where we discuss various issues and move the spec forward. We alternate between hour long calls where we aim to talk through the issues in front of us, and 3 hour long 'working sessions' where people find some dedicated time to work on STAC, with others on the video call at the same time for any questions or collaboration. 

The other main locus of community activity is the [stac-spec repo](/). We also have a [stac-spec Google group](), where there are occasional messages.`
